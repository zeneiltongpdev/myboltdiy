# File and Folder Locking Feature Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds persistent file and folder locking functionality to the BoltDIY project. When a file or folder is locked, it cannot be modified by either the user or the AI until it is unlocked. All locks are scoped to the current chat/project to prevent locks from one project affecting files with matching names in other projects.

## New Files

### 1. `app/components/chat/LockAlert.tsx`

- A dedicated alert component for displaying lock-related error messages
- Features a distinctive amber/yellow color scheme and lock icon
- Provides clear instructions to the user about locked files

### 2. `app/lib/persistence/lockedFiles.ts`

- Core functionality for persisting file and folder locks in localStorage
- Provides functions for adding, removing, and retrieving locked files and folders
- Defines the lock modes: "full" (no modifications) and "scoped" (only additions allowed)
- Implements chat ID scoping to isolate locks to specific projects

### 3. `app/utils/fileLocks.ts`

- Utility functions for checking if a file or folder is locked
- Helps avoid circular dependencies between components and stores
- Provides a consistent interface for lock checking across the application
- Extracts chat ID from URL for project-specific lock scoping
