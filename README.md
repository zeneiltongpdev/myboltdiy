## Setup Using Git (For Developers only)

This method is recommended for developers who want to:

- Contribute to the project
- Stay updated with the latest changes
- Switch between different versions
- Create custom modifications

#### Prerequisites

1. Install Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone -b stable https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd bolt.diy
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **(OPTIONAL)** Switch to the Main Branch if you want to use pre-release/testbranch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   pnpm install
   pnpm run dev
   ```
  Hint: Be aware that this can have beta-features and more likely got bugs than the stable release

>**Open the WebUI to test (Default: http://localhost:5173)**
>   - Beginners: 
>     - Try to use a sophisticated Provider/Model like Anthropic with Claude Sonnet 3.x Models to get best results
>     - Explanation: The System Prompt currently implemented in bolt.diy cant cover the best performance for all providers and models out there. So it works better with some models, then other, even if the models itself are perfect for >programming
>     - Future: Planned is a Plugin/Extentions-Library so there can be different System Prompts for different Models, which will help to get better results

#### Staying Updated

To get the latest changes from the repository:

1. **Save Your Local Changes** (if any):

   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. **Pull Latest Updates**:
